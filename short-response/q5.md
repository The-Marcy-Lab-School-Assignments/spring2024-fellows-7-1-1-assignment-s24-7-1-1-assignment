# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

2 and 3 will match the id paths because they match the param conditions. `:id` doesn't necessarily have to be a number so it can be matched to either `apple` or `5`. 1 does not have any conditions for `:id` to go to and 4 has an additional condition following the `:id` path.
